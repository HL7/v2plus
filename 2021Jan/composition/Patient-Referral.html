PURPOSE
</h2>

        <p class="v2">The Patient Referral chapter defines the message set used in patient referral communications between mutually exclusive healthcare entities.  These referral transactions frequently occur between entities with different methods and systems of capturing and storing data.  Such transactions frequently traverse a path connecting primary care providers, specialists, payors, government agencies, hospitals, labs, and other healthcare entities.  The availability, completeness, and currency of information for a given patient will vary greatly across such a spectrum.</p>
        <p class="v2">The referral in this specification is viewed from the perspective of the provider as an individual, irrespective of his/her affiliation with a specific institution or campus.  Events triggering this kind of message are not restricted to a hospital environment, but have a community-wide area of impact in which more extensive identification of patients and healthcare providers is needed.  Therefore, a referral must contain adequate identification information to meet the broadly varying requirements of the dissimilar systems within the community.</p>
        <p class="v2">This chapter describes the various events and resulting transactions that make up the referral message set.  Examples have been provided to demonstrate the use of this specification within the events described.  Each event example centers on a primary care provider's encounter with a patient.  All of the examples in this chapter have been constructed using the HL7 Encoding Rules.</p>

Patient Referral and Responses
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">When a patient is referred by one healthcare entity (e.g., a primary care provider) to another (e.g., a specialist or lab) or when a patient inquiry is made between two separate entities, little is known about the information each party requires to identify or codify the patient.  The receiving entity may have no knowledge of the patient and may require a full set of demographics, subscriber and billing information, eligibility/coverage information, pre-authorization information, and/or clinical data to process the referral. If the receiving entity already has a record of the patient, the precise requirements for identifying that patient record will vary greatly from one entity to another.  The existing record of a patient residing in the database of a specialist, a lab, or a hospital may require updating with more current information.  In addition, providers receiving a referral often require detailed information about the provider making the referral, such as a physician's name and address.</p>
          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">For example, a primary care provider making a referral may need to obtain insurance information or pre-authorization from a payor prior to making a referral.  Getting this information requires an inquiry and a response between the primary care provider and the payor.  In addition, the primary care provider may request results from a lab to accompany the referral.  Getting these results may require an inquiry and a response between the primary care provider and the lab.  The information could then be incorporated into a referral sent from the primary care provider to the specialist.  As the referral is processed, requested procedures are performed, the results are observed, and the relevant data must be returned to the primary care provider.  Such a response may frequently take the form of multiple responses as results become available.</p>
          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The message set that encompasses these transactions includes the referral (REF), requests for information (RQA, RQC, RQP, RQI) and the returned patient information (RCI, RCL, RPA, RPI, RPL, RRI).  The referral message originates a transaction and a return patient information message concludes the transaction.  At least one RPA/RPI is required to complete a patient referral or a patient request transaction, although multiple RPI messages may be returned in response to a single REF message.  The segments used in the REF, RQA, RQI, RQP, RRI, RPH, RCI, RCL, RPA and RPI messages encompass information about patient, guarantor and next of kin demographics, eligibility/coverage information, accident, diagnosis, requested procedures, payor pre-authorization, notes, and referring and consulting provider data.</p>

Patient referral
</h4>

            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">There are clear distinctions between a referral and an order.  An order is almost always an intra-enterprise transaction and represents a request from a patient's active provider to supporting providers for clearly defined services and/or results.  While the supporting provider may exercise great discretion in the performance of an order, overall responsibility for the patient's plan of treatment remains with the ordering provider.  As such, the ordering provider retains significant control authority for the order and can, after the fact, cause the order to be canceled, reinstated, etc.  Additionally, detailed results produced by the supporting provider are always reported back to the ordering provider, who remains ultimately responsible for evaluating their value and relevance.  A referral, on the other hand, can be either an intra- or an inter-enterprise transaction and represents not only a request for additional provider support but also a transfer of a portion or all of the responsibility for the patient's plan of treatment.  Once the referral is made, the referring provider, during the transfer period, retains almost no control of any resulting actions.  The referred-to provider becomes responsible for placing any additional orders and for evaluating the value and relevance of any results, which may or may not be automatically passed back to the referring provider.  A referred-to provider may, in turn, also become a referring provider. </p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">A referral message is used to support transactions related to the referral of a patient from one healthcare provider to another.  This kind of message will be particularly useful from the perspective of a primary care provider referring a patient to a specialist.  However, the application of the message should not be limited to this model.  For example, a referral may be as simple as a physician sending a patient to another physician for a consultation or it may be as complex as a primary care provider sending a patient to a specialist for specific medical procedures to be performed and attaching the payor authorizations for those requested procedures as well as the relevant clinical information on the patient's case.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">In a community model, stringent security requirements will need to be met when dealing with the release of clinical information.  This message set facilitates the proper qualification of requests because the message packet will contain all the data required by any application in the community, including the necessary patient demographic information and the proper identification of the party requesting the information.  </p>

Responding to a patient referral
</h4>

            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">When a patient is referred by one provider to another or is pre-admitted, there is a great likelihood that subsequent transactions will take place between the initiating entity (the referring or admitting physician) and the responding entity (the specialist or hospital).  The subsequent transactions might include a variety of queries, orders, etc.  Within those subsequent transactions, there must be a way for the initiating system to refer to the patient.  The "generic" patient information included in the original referral or the pre-admit Patient Identification (PID) segment may not be detailed enough to locate the patient in the responding facility's database, unless the responding facility has assigned a unique identifier to the new patient.  Similarly, the responding system may not have record retrieval capabilities based on any of the unambiguous, facility-neutral data elements (like the Social Security Number) included in the original referral or pre-admit PID segment.  This problem could result in the responding system associating subsequent orders or requests with the wrong patient.  One solution to this potential problem is for the responding system to utilize the RRI message and return to the initiating system the unique internal identifier it assigns to the patient, and with which it will primarily (or even exclusively) refer to that patient in all subsequent update operations.  However, the intent of the RRI message is that it will supply the originator of the referral type message with sufficient patient demographic and/or clinical information to properly process continued transactions.</p>

Communicating Collaborative Care of a Patient
</h4>

            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">When providers collaborate in the sharing of patient care there can be many types of communications involved, and the expectations, roles and responsibilities may not always be clear and explicit; they may vary in different jurisdictions or work practice environments. </p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The use of HL7 Version 2.x in clinical messaging has involved the use of segments in ways for which they were not originally intended, as well as the development of the REL segment to express important relationships between clinical data components.  Such use has also necessitated the introduction of mood codes to allow for the richer representation of intent, purpose, timing, and other event contingencies that such concepts required.  When these extensions are applied to segments in messages which predate them there is the risk that a message generated by a system compliant with an earlier release could be misinterpreted by a system which interprets the segments in the wider context.  The approach to this has been to constrain the use of the enhancements to these segments to new messages, or to newer versions of existing messages. The REF message has been in releases which pre-date the v2.6 clinical enhancements and its limitations in this regard, together with the need for a range of new Collaborative Care interactions, have led to the need for the Collaborative Care Message.  Being developed to use the clinical v2.6 enhancements from the outset, the collaborative care messages do not need these versioning constraints around their use.</p>

Application Roles and Data Process
</h3>

<h4 class='v2'>
Application roles
</h4>

            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This Standard assumes that there are four roles that an application can take on: a referring or referred-by provider application role, a referred-to provider application role, a querying application role, and an auxiliary application role.  These application roles define the interactions an application will have with other applications in the messaging environment.  In many environments, any single application may take on more than one application role.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This Standard's definition of application roles does not intend to define or limit the functionality of specific products developed by vendors of such applications.  Instead, this information is provided to help define the model used to develop this Standard, and to provide an unambiguous way for applications to communicate with each other.</p>

<div class='v2-composition-section-4' id='Patient-Referral-2-2-2'>
<h4 class='v2'>
The referring provider application role
</h4>

            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">A referring provider application requests the services of another healthcare provider (a referred-to provider) application.  There may or may not be any association between the referring provider application and the receiving entity.  Although in most cases a referral environment will be inter-enterprise in nature, it is not limited to that model and applies to intra-enterprise situations also.  Because the referring provider application cannot exert any control over the referred-to provider application, it must send requests to modify the status of the referred-to provider application.  The referring provider application will often assume an auxiliary application role once a patient has been accepted by another application.  Once this happens, the referring provider application may receive unsolicited status updates from the referred-to provider application concerning the care of a patient.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The analog of a referring provider application in a non-automated environment might be a primary care provider diagnosing a patient with a problem that must in turn be referred to a specialist for a service.  The primary care provider would contact the specialist and refer the patient into his care.  Often, the specialist may not receive the patient into his care, preferring instead to refer the patient to another healthcare provider.  The referring provider will indicate the diagnosis and any requested services, and the specialist to whom the patient is referred will indicate whether the referral will be accepted as specified.  Once a patient referral has been accepted by the specialist, the specialist may send out updates to the primary care provider concerning the status of the patient as regards any tests performed, their outcomes, etc.</p>

<div class='v2-composition-section-4' id='Patient-Referral-2-2-3'>
<h4 class='v2'>
The referred-to provider application role
</h4>

            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">A referred-to provider application, in the referral model, is one that performs one or more services requested by another healthcare provider (referring provider).  In other words, a referred-to provider application exerts control over a certain set of services and defines the availability of those services.  Because of this control, no other application has the ability to accept, reject, or otherwise modify a referral accepted by a particular referred-to provider application.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Other applications can, on the other hand, make requests to modify the status of an accepted referral "owned by" the referred-to provider application.  The referred-to provider application either grants or denies requests for information, or otherwise modifies the referrals for the services over which it exerts control.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Finally, the referred-to provider application also provides information about the referral encounter to other applications.  The reasons that an application may be interested in receiving such information are varied.  An application may have previously requested the status of the referral encounter, or it may simply be interested in the information for its own clinical reporting or statistical purposes.  There are two methods whereby the referred-to provider applications disseminate this information: by issuing unsolicited information messages to auxiliary applications, or by responding to queries made by querying applications.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The analog of a referred-to provider application in a non-automated environment might be a specialist such as a cardiologist.  A patient does not generally go to a cardiologist for routine health care.  Instead, a patient generally goes to a primary care provider, who may diagnose the patient with a heart ailment and refer that patient to a cardiologist.  The cardiologist would review the information provided with the referral request and determine whether or not to accept the patient into his care.  Once the cardiologist accepts the patient, anyone needing information on the status of the patient must then make requests to the cardiologist.  In addition, the cardiologist may forward unsolicited information regarding the treatment of the patient back to the primary care provider.  Once the cardiologist accepts the referred patient, he/she may determine that additional information regarding the patient is needed.  It will often take the role of a querying application by sending a query message to the patient's primary care provider and requesting additional information on demographics, insurance information, laboratory test results, etc.</p>

<div class='v2-composition-section-4' id='Patient-Referral-2-2-4'>
<h4 class='v2'>
The querying application role
</h4>

            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">A querying application neither exerts control over, nor requests changes to a referral.  Rather than accepting unsolicited information about referrals, as does an auxiliary application, the querying application actively solicits this information using a query mechanism.  It will, in general, be driven by an entity seeking information about a referral such as a referring provider application or an entity seeking information about a referred patient such as a referred-to provider application.  The information that the querying application receives is valid only at the exact time that the query results are generated by the provider applications.  Changes made to the referral or the referred patient's status after the query results have been returned are not communicated to the querying application until it issues another query transaction.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The analog of a querying application in a non-automated environment might be a primary care provider seeking information about a specific patient who has been referred to a specialist.  For example, a patient may have been referred to a specialist in order that a specific test be performed, following which, the patient would return to the primary care provider.  If the specialist has not forwarded information regarding the testing procedures for the patient to the primary care provider, the primary care provider would then query the specialist for the outcome of those procedures.  Likewise, if a specialist received a referred patient without the preliminary diagnoses of test results, he/she might in turn query the primary care provider for the information leading to the diagnoses and subsequent referral.</p>

The auxiliary application role
</h4>

            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Like querying applications, an auxiliary application neither exerts control over nor requests changes to a referral or a referred patient.  They, too, are only concerned with gathering information about a particular referral.  An auxiliary application is considered an "interested third-party," in that it is interested in any changes to a particular referral or referred patient, but has no interest in changing it or controlling it in any way.  An auxiliary application passively collects information by receiving unsolicited updates from a provider application.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The analog of an auxiliary application in a non-automated environment might be any person receiving reports containing referral information.  For example, an insurance company may need information about the activities a patient experiences during specific referral encounters.  Primary care providers may need to forward information regarding all referred patients to a payor organization.</p>
            <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">In turn, a primary care provider may have the ability to track electronically a patient's medical record.  The provider would then be very interested in receiving any information regarding a patient referred to a specialist.</p>

Acknowledgment Choreography
</h3>

          <p class="v2">As of Version 2.9 Infrastructure and Messaging requires that Acknowledgment Choreography be explicitly specified in MSH-15 and MSH-16. Because of the nature of the Query and Response Messaging pattern, the Response message is always an Application Acknowledgment. To specify this, the value in MSH-16 SHALL always be “AL” for those messages that are Queries, to indicate that there will always be an Application Acknowledgment to the Query Message. See Chapter 2 for more details on this subject.</p>

RQI/RPL - Request/Receipt of Patient Selection Display List (Event I02)
</h3>

          <p class="v2">This trigger event occurs when the inquirer specifies a request for a name lookup listing.  Generally, this request is used by the responder when insufficient data is on hand for a positive match.  In this case, the requester may ask for a list of possible candidates from which to make a selection.  This event code is also used by the responder to signify that the return information contains a list of information rather than information specific to a single patient.</p>

Although this message also pertains to the payor, it differs greatly from that of an insurance information request.  This message is used to request an authorization for specific procedures.

The specific medical procedures must be filled out in the PR1 segments.  Each repeating PR1 segment may be paired with an AUT segment so that authorization information can be given regarding dollar amounts, number of treatments, and perhaps the estimated length of stay for treatment.  The OBR and OBX segments should be used to include any relevant clinical information that may be required to support or process the authorization.</p>

This message fulfills the role of a notification of a single patient's health status and history.  It is usable for discharge summaries, disease notifications or just moving a patient's electronic medical record from one the place to another.

CCR/ACK – Collaborative Care Referral (Events I16-I18)
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The trigger events that use this message are described in the sections below. The Collaborate Care Referral message is sent from one healthcare provider to another regarding a specific patient or group of patients.  The collaborative care referral may contain specific clinical orders, patient demographic information, a full history of appointments, specific medical procedures that have been performed, a full clinical history, an administrative history of patient visits, a full medication history, all relevant problems, pathways and goal. This message uses the REL segment to express the relationships between patients and clinical orders and/or clinical histories, patients and patient visits, patients and medical histories, patients and problems, goals and pathways, as well as patients and providers, and providers and patient problems, goals and patient pathways. The REL segments can also be used to express the relationships between providers. The collaborative care referral message definitely implies intent to share, or transfer some, or all, of the care of the patient to the referred to provider or providers.</p>

CCR/ACK – Collaborative Care Referral (Event I16)
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This event triggers a message to be sent from one healthcare provider to another regarding a specific patient or group of patients.  The intent is to create a collaborative relationship between the referring provider, the referred to provider or providers and the patient or patients, for the shared care of the patient or patients. Whilst the acknowledgment is a simple ACK message, the expectation is that the referred to provider(s) will send back a CCU – Asynchronous Collaborative Care Update at a later time to indicate acceptance or rejection of the referral.</p>

CCR/ACK – Modify Collaborative Care Referral (Event I17)
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This event triggers a message to be sent from one healthcare provider to another regarding changes to an existing Collaborative Care Referral. Changes may include additional instructions from the referring provider, additional clinical orders, additional clinical history, additional patient visits, additional medication history, or modifications to the problems, goals and/or pathways. Whilst the acknowledgment is a simple ACK message, the expectation is that the referred to provider(s) will send back a CCU – Asynchronous Collaborative Care Update at a later time to indicate acceptance or rejection of the modifications.</p>

CCR/ACK – Cancel Collaborative Care Referral (Event I18)

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This event triggers a message to be sent from one healthcare provider to another canceling an existing Collaborative Care Referral.  A previous Collaborative Care Referral may have been made in error, or perhaps the cancellation has come from the patient. Whilst the acknowledgment is a simple ACK message, the expectation is that the referred to provider(s) will send back a CCU – Asynchronous Collaborative Care Update at a later time to indicate cancellation of the Collaborative Care Referral.</p>

CCU/ACK – Asynchronous Collaborative Care Update (Event I20)
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This event triggers a message to be sent from a referred to healthcare provider to the referring health care provider, regarding a specific, previously received collaborative care referral. The collaborative care update may contain patient demographic information, additional appointments, additional clinical history, additional patient visits and additional medication history. It may also contain updates of patient problems, pathways and goal. The information is similar to that which may have been provided in the original Collaborate Care Referral message, but significantly different, as it is information from the perspective of the referred to provider. Patient visits will be those visits by the patient, to the referred to provider, relating to the referral. Appointments will be appointments made for the patient, by the referred to provider, during those visits. Clinical history will be observations made during those visits and medication history will be medications prescribed, observed or recommended during those visits. This message is used to update the referring provider as to the current status of the referral. The referrer would also use this message to update of the status of a referral, such as accepted, rejected, patient put on waiting list, treatment completed etc.</p>

COLLABORATIVE CARE INFORMATION REQUEST MESSAGES AND TRIGGER EVENTS
</h2>

        <p class="v2">Collaborative care information may need to be retrieved from various entities, such as healthcare providers, clinical repositories or regulatory bodies.  The definition of these entities often varies greatly. Some times the query will relate to a previous referral. At other times it will relate to a specific patient.</p>

CCQ/CQU – Collaborative Care Query/Collaborative Care Query Update (Event I19)
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This event triggers a query message to be sent from a referring healthcare provider to a referred to healthcare provider, regarding a specific, previously sent collaborative care referral. The Collaborative Care Query message must contain sufficient data for the referred to provider to be able to identify the specific referral being queried. The response to a Collaborative Care Query message is a CQU - Collaborative Care Query Update message. The meaning of the Collaborative Care Query Update message is identical to the meaning of the Asynchronous Collaborative Care Update message.</p>

The Collaborative Care Fetch message must contain sufficient information for the healthcare provider, clinical repository or regulatory body to be able to identify the specific patient. The response to a Collaborative Care Fetch is a CCI - Collaborative Care Information message.

For example, when a primary care provider (referring provider) sends a referral to a specialist (referred-to provider), the specialist's application system may accept the referral and assign it a new referral identifier which uniquely identifies that particular referral within the specialist's application system.  This new referral identifier would be placed in the external referral identifier field when the specialist responds to the primary care physician.</p>

This field is conditionally required.  It is not required when authorization information is being requested.  However, it is required when this segment is contained in a message which is responding to a request and contains the authorization information.  This is a composite field.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The first component of this field is a string of up to 15 characters that identifies an individual authorization.  It is assigned by the coverage application, and it identifies an authorization, and the subsequent billing transactions resulting from the given authorization, uniquely among all such authorizations granted from a particular processing application.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The second component is optional because this field, itself, is already defined as an <em>authorization identifier</em>.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The third component is optional.  If used it should contain the application identifier for the coverage application. The application identifier is a string of up to six characters that is uniquely associated with an application.  A given healthcare provider facility, or group of intercommunicating healthcare provider facilities, should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential originators and recipients, and then assign unique application identifiers to each of those applications.  This list of application identifiers becomes one of the healthcare provider facility's master dictionary lists.  Since applications fulfilling different application roles can send and receive referral messages containing authorizations, the coverage application identifier may not identify the application sending or receiving a particular message.  Data elements on the Message Header (MSH) segment are available to identify the actual sending and receiving applications.</p>

PRD - Provider Data Segment

The PRD segment contains data specifically focused on a referral, and it is inter-enterprise in nature.  The justification for this new segment comes from the fact that we are dealing with referrals that are external to the facilities that received them.  Therefore, using a segment such as the current PV1 would be inadequate for all the return information that may be required by the receiving facility or application.  In addition, the PV1 does not always provide information sufficient to enable the external facility to make a complete identification of the referring entity.  The information contained in the PRD segment will include the referring provider, the referred-to provider, the referred-to location or service, and the referring provider clinic address. </p>

</h4>
<div>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  This field contains the contact role that defines the relationship of the person or organization described in this segment to the patient being referred.  When a referral is inter-enterprise in nature, there are several important relationships that must be identified.  For example, the proper identification of both the referring and the referred-to provider is critical for proper processing of a referral.  In addition, some enterprises may want information regarding a consulting provider or the identity of the person who actually prepared the referral.  This contact role may also expand to represent affiliated persons to whom information regarding this referral must be forwarded or copied.  Refer to <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v2/0286/index.html">User-defined Table 0286 - Provider Role</a> for suggested values. </p>

Generally, this field will describe a physician associated with the referral.  However, it is not limited to physicians.  If the provider is an organization then <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/PRD.html#PRD-10">PRD-10 – Provider Organization Name and Identifier</a> will be used.  This field may contain the name of any valid healthcare provider associated with this referral.  If this Provider Name is a physician's name, you may refer to <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/PRD.html#PRD-7">PRD-7-Provider identifiers</a> for the physician identifier. </p>

<div>

For example, if this provider represented the referred-to physician, the <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/PRD.html#PRD-4">PRD-4-Provider location</a> should identify the clinic of the physician or provider to whom this referral has been sent.  An application and facility identifier carried in the facility field specifies the identification of the provider's location.  The application ID and facility ID would be used in the same manner as their corresponding fields in the MSH segment (<a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/MSH.html#MSH-3">MSH-3-Sending application, MSH-5-Receiving application,</a> <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/MSH.html#MSH-4">MSH-4-Sending facility, MSH-6-Receiving facility</a>).  That is, the facility field will contain an application identifier and facility identifier which describe the location of this provider.  However, it should be noted that they may describe a different location because the provider location being referenced in this field <em>may not be</em> the location from which the message originated, which is being described by the MSH.</p>

CTD - Contact Data Segment
</h3>
<div>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The CTD segment may identify any contact personnel associated with a patient referral message and its related transactions.  The CTD segment will be paired with a PRD segment.  The PRD segment contains data specifically focused on provider information in a referral.  While it is important in an inter-enterprise transaction to transmit specific information regarding the providers involved (referring and referred-to), it may also be important to identify the contact personnel associated with the given provider.  For example, a provider receiving a referral may need to know the office manager or the billing person at the institution of the provider who sent the referral.  This segment allows for multiple contact personnel to be associated with a single provider.</p>

EXAMPLES
</h2>

        <p class="v2">The following examples will demonstrate the proposed way in which the RQI, RQA and REF messages can be used with the I01 (request for insurance information), I08 (request for treatment authorization information), I15 (request patient referral status) and I06 (request/receipt of clinical data listing) event codes.  The events are presented in the order in which they would occur in a typical patient encounter.  The first event to occur when the patient visits the medical practice is the verification of eligibility/coverage information.  Next, the patient will be diagnosed and may be referred to a specialist for further treatment.  This procedure may require a request for pre-authorization from the payor, which will be forwarded to the referral provider.  Once the referral provider begins treatment, messages regarding the status or outcome of the treatment will be sent to the referring provider.  Queries may also be sent to the specialist and reference laboratories.</p>

RQI Message Using an I01 Event with an Immediate Response
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">When a patient arrives for an appointment, the office staff will frequently need to verify the patient's insurance information.  In the following RQI message example, Dr. Hippocrates is sending an insurance information request to the H. C. Payor Insurance Company for his patient, Adam A. Everyman.  The response from the payor is shown in a more complete IN1 segment.  However, it should be noted that in addition to the IN1 segment, this return information could have been placed in the NTE segment to serve as display data.  This strategy would serve a broader community of diverse application systems that might have different levels of ability to process the record-formatted data.</p>

RQA Message Using an I08 Event with an Immediate Response
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">When the attending physician decides to refer the patient for treatment to another healthcare provider, pre-authorization may be required by the payor.  In the following RQA example, Dr. Blake is requesting the appropriate pre-authorization from H.C Payor Insurance Company for a colonoscopy on Adam Everyman.  The request includes the diagnosis, in case it is a factor in the approval decision.  As shown below, the immediate response indicates approval of the request that was made on 01/10/94 and that expires on 05/10/94.  In actuality, most payors require some human intervention in the pre-authorization process and would probably not respond immediately.</p>

The referral message includes the patient's demographic information, diagnosis and the pre-authorization information retrieved during the previous transaction.  The dates contained in the pre-authorization segment (e.g., authorization date and authorization expiration date) pertain to the authorization, given by a payor, for a specified procedure.  They are not intended to imply any kind of schedule request.  Scheduling will be handled by the referral provider and the patient in a separate transaction.  Not all referrals will require a detailed chain of response messages, so in this case, a simple acknowledgment in the form of an RPI is returned with a note from the referred-to provider.</p>

REF Message Using an I11 Event with a Deferred Response
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The following example demonstrates the ability of the referral provider to return a series of responses.  For most referrals, multiple responses will be returned because referrals may contain multiple requested procedures that may be performed over a period of time.  The referral provider determines the completion of this chain of messages and indicates that designation in the following example by setting the "Processed" flag in the MSA segment.  This procedure will probably vary from network to network. </p>

HL7 Overlapping With ASC X12N
</h3>

          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">There have been discussions regarding overlap of the proposed Patient Referral Chapter with recent development efforts by a committee within the ASC X12N organization.  In the Healthcare Task Group (Task Group 2) of the ASC X12N Insurance Subcommittee, the Services Review Working Group (Working Group 10) has been working on a referral transaction (Transaction 278).  This transaction has been designed from a payor perspective by focusing on <em>certification</em> of a referral or <em>notification</em> that a referral took place.  This focus deals primarily with the financial or reimbursement side of a referral.  There are some similarities between the two messages.  However, there are also some clear differences.  For example, the ASC X12 transaction does not provide for provider-to-provider referrals containing clinical data.  Referrals containing a patient's clinical record along with diagnoses and requested procedures are the major focus of the work being done by HL7.  In an effort to alleviate some of the controversy that this issue has caused, sections of this HL7 Patient Referral chapter have been removed.  These sections dealt primarily with eligibility and plan coverage information.  That information will be specifically handled by ASC X12N transactions 271 and 272, and the new interactive transactions.</p>
          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">There are some convergence activities currently in progress.  The HL7 - X12 Joint Coordinating Committee has been formed to facilitate efforts to unify these two standard development organizations as well as others.  Work is in progress to harmonize HL7 trigger events within X12N transactions, as well as in joint data modeling.  There has also been some work done at the working group level to harmonize the common data segments of the two respective referral messages.  There is ongoing participation by both HL7 committees and X12N work groups to achieve a certain level of data compatibility.</p>
          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The HL7 Board of Directors has directed HL7 to continue development of the Patient Referral Chapter for the following reasons:</p>
          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The HL7 - X12 coordination is ongoing, but will not be complete in time for Standard Version 2.7.</p>
          <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The HL7 Patient Referral Chapter addresses business needs that the X12 transaction does not (e.g., transmission of codified clinical data).</p>
