      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">If a new appointment must be booked, it may be necessary to provide a schedule ID to uniquely identify the intended slot(s) being requested in the transaction.  After the request has been assigned to one or more slots; however, the filler application should assign a unique filler appointment ID (see sections <a href="/2021Jan/composition/Scheduling.html#Scheduling-6-1-1">10.6.1.1</a>, "<a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ARQ.html#ARQ-1">ARQ-1   Placer Appointment ID   (EI)   00860</a>," and <a href="/2021Jan/composition/Scheduling.html#Scheduling-6-1-2">10.6.1.2</a>, "<a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ARQ.html#ARQ-2">ARQ-2   Filler Appointment ID   (EI)   00861</a>)."  This filler appointment ID, as its definition indicates, should uniquely identify the appointment among all such requests and appointments within the filler application.  This means that, once assigned, the filler appointment ID should uniquely identify the appointment (either as a request or as a booked appointment) without a need to provide the schedule ID too.  As a cautionary note regarding implementation, if the filler appointment ID would not otherwise be unique, it may be necessary to include the schedule ID as part of the filler appointment ID.  This can be done either by prefixing the appointment ID with the schedule ID, or by appending the schedule ID to the appointment ID.</p>

ARQ-11: Requested Start Date/Time Range (<a href='/2021Jan/data-type/DR.html'>DR</a>) 00870
</h4>
<div>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  This field contains the date and time that the appointment is requested to begin, in the form of a date/time range.  The first component contains the earliest date and time that the appointment may be scheduled to begin.  The second component contains the latest date and time that the appointment may be scheduled to begin.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The DTM (time stamp) data type allows for two components: the time stamp, and a degree of precision.  If used, the degree of precision should be separated from the time stamp by a subcomponent delimiter.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">If only the range start date/time has been provided, then the range end date/time is assumed to be infinity.  Using this scenario is equivalent to requesting the next available slot on/after a particular date and time.  If only the range end date/time has been provided, then the range start date/time is assumed to be immediate.  Using this scenario is equivalent to requesting the appointment start some time between the current date and time, and the specified range end date/time.  Requesting an appointment when the range start and range end date/time are the same is equivalent to requesting a specific slot on a schedule.  If this field is unvalued, then the filler application will assume that the next available slot should be scheduled, using the institution's processing rules for scheduling appointments.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This field may repeat.  Repetitions of this field are used to construct a list of acceptable ranges.  Repetitions of this field are connected with a logical OR to construct this list.  This procedure allows applications to provide multiple preferences for the scheduling of appointments.  Applications should take steps to ensure that nonsensical ranges are not indicated in this field (for example, redundant ranges).</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Examples:</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Schedule the appointment to begin at some time between 8:00AM on Tuesday, May 17th, 1994 and 12:00PM on Friday, May 20th, 1994 local time:</p>

      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Schedule the appointment in the next available slot on/after 6:00AM on Monday, April 25th, 1994 local time:</p>

      <div class="v2-note">
        <p class="v2">Note:  The field value ...|199405250600|... is equivalent to making the above request, according to the HL7 rules for processing fields.</p>

      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Schedule the appointment to begin on any weekday during the two weeks beginning Monday, April 4th, 1994.  In this example, the degree of precision (sub)component of the time stamp is used to indicate that the date/time ranges refer to the institution's standard operating day:</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-example">...|199404040000&amp;D^199404080000&amp;D~199404110000&amp;D^199404150000&amp;D|...</p>

In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.  </p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-1">ORC-1-order control</a> equal to "CA" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.</p>

      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  This field is the order number associated with the filling application.  Where a transcription service or similar organization creates the document and uses an internally unique identifier, that number should be inserted in this field.  Its first component is a string of characters that identifies an order detail segment (i.e., OBR).  This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (i.e., transcription service).  This uniqueness must persist over time.  Where a number is reused over time, a date can be affixed to the non-unique number to make it unique.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The second through fourth components contains the (filler) assigning authority.  The (filler) assigning authority is a string of characters that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network.  The second through fourth components of the filler order number always identify the actual filler of an order.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">TXA-15 - Condition: If corresponding ORC and/or OBR segments are present in the message and ORC-3 or OBR-3 is valued, this field must be blank.  If TXA-14 is valued while ORC-3 or OBR-3 is valued it shall be ignored.  See message definitions including TXA for further guidanceon which ORC/OBR pairs to consider.</p>
