      </ol>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented v2-indent1020">The Standard supports a mechanism to collect several orders together in a group.  Most often this is used to represent an "ordering session" for a single patient. A common use case is the grouping of laboratory batteries and tests ordered together by a physician for a patient with a common diagnostic goal (e.g. preoperative blood testing, diabetes follow-up, …).</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">An order group is a list of orders (ORCs) associated with an <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-4">ORC-4-placer group number</a>.  A group is established when the placer supplies a placer group number with the original order or when the filler accessions the order group and supplies a filler group number with the received order. The order group may be identified by the placer or by the filler or by both applications.  The order group consists of all the ORCs and order detail segments that have the same placer group number, or using the assign number/number assigned  mechanism.  Orders can be removed from the group using cancel, or added using the replacement or parent-child mechanisms.  New orders cannot otherwise be added to the group.</p>

        <li class="v2 v2-li">
          <p class="v2 v2-normallistalpha">duplicate fields</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented v2-indent1020">The ORC is intended to uniformly define the fields that are common to all orders (i.e., requested services).  Some ORC fields are duplicated in some order detail segments (e.g., OBR, RXO).  For example, <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-2">ORC-2-placer order number</a> has the same meaning and purpose as <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/OBR.html#OBR-2">OBR-2-placer order number</a> field.  This promotes upward compatibility with past versions and ASTM.  </p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented v2-indent1020">The rule for using these fields is that the value must appear in the order detail segment if it does not appear in the ORC.  However, it is recommended to transmit the field value in both places to avoid confusion.</p>
      <ol class="v2 v2-list v2-lower-alpha-list v2-normallistalpha" style="list-style: lower-alpha">
        <li class="v2 v2-li">

      </ol>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented v2-indent1020">During transmission of a request to cancel, hold, or discontinue a parent order, the request is intended to apply recursively to the parent order and all associated child orders.  </p>

        </li>
        <li class="v2 v2-li">
          <p class="v2 v2-normallistnumbered">ORC-7 Quantity/Timing - This field was retained for backward compatibility only as of v 2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7. The reader is referred to the TQ1 – Timing/Quantity and TQ2 – Timing/Quantity Relationship segments described in sections 4.5.4 and 4.5.5, respectively.  The purpose of this field (and now these segments) is to capture Priority, Frequency, and Timing of the service being ordered.  For example, an order for a unit of blood to be administered to a patient every morning for 3 days..</p>
        </li>
        <li class="v2 v2-li">
          <p class="v2 v2-normallistnumbered">ORC-9 Date/Time of Order Event – This field is the date/time when the action indicated in ORC-1 was initiated.  Every time a new action, as indicated by ORC-1, occurs the date/time of that action should appear in ORC-9. This field is not equivalent to MSH-7 Date and Time of Message, which reflects the date/time of message generation.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="v2 v2-li">
          <p class="v2 v2-normallistnumbered">ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time – The field focuses on when the information communicated is to take effect.  It is most appropriate when used on an order that is by nature a “continuing” (or continuous) order. This field has a close relationship to ORC-9 and the TQ1, TQ2 segments in so much as the value in ORC-15 takes precedence over both.  For example, an order is placed on June 1, for an activity that is to be performed over ten days as indicated in the TQ1 segment.  The Filler then receives a cancel message on June 2 with the ORC-9 value of June 2, but the ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time indicated the cancel is to be effective on June 7th.  ORC-15 by taking precedence over TQ1 and ORC-9, would tell the Filler to continue to perform the order event until June 7, and cancel all remaining events (treatment, procedures etc.) after that time.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="v2 v2-li">
          <p class="v2 v2-normallistnumbered">ORC-27 Filler’s Expected Availability Date/Time – This field focuses on when the filler expects to complete the order, e.g., have the results available, the prescription ready, etc.  This is a Filler assigned field and would typically only be sent from Filler to Placer on either application level acknowledgments or order status messages.  (Could be delivered with result messag but would have little relevance at that time.)</p>
        </li>
        <li class="v2 v2-li">
          <p class="v2 v2-normallistnumbered">ORC-32 Advanced Beneficiary Notice Date – This field contains the date the patient gave consent to pay for potentially uninsured services or the date that the Advanced Beneficiary Notice Code (ORC-20) was collected.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="v2 v2-li">
          <p class="v2 v2-normallistnumbered">ORC-36 Order Status Range – This field is a Filler assigned date/time indicating a date range that the ORC-5 Order Status is intended to be effective.  For example, if the Filler recommends an alternate test, and sets the ORC-5 status to “Hold”, this date/time reflects how long the Filler will keep the order in that status (barring additional communications from the Placer or Filler in regard to this order.)</p>
        </li>
        <li class="v2 v2-li">
          <p class="v2 v2-normallistnumbered">ORC-37 Order Creation Date/Time – focuses on the date that the order was originally created; whether as an electronic order or as an initial paper requisition.  This date/time is designed to preserve the creation date/time from initial order to final result, and for all stages in-between.  (Acknowledgments, Updates, Cancels, etc.)</p>

<div>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  Determines the function of the order segment.  Refer to HL7 Table 0119 – Order Control Codes in Chapter 2C, Code Tables, for valid entries.  Depending on the message, the action of the control code may refer to an order or an individual service.  For example, the code CA in an OMP message cancels the order.  The same code in an RDS message, cancels the dispense.  Very detailed explanatory notes are given at the end of this section.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This field may be considered the "trigger event" identifier for orders.  The codes fall roughly into the following three categories:</p>

          <p class="v2 v2-normallistalpha">event acknowledgment – Codes like "OK" (order accepted) and "CR" (canceled as requested) are used to reply to the event request .</p>

          <p class="v2 v2-normallistalpha">event notification – Codes like "OC" (order canceled) and "OD" (order discontinued) are used to notify other applications that an event has occurred.  No application reply is necessary. </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Event request codes are intended to initiate an event.  Event acknowledgment codes are intended to reply to an application that requested an event.  Event notification codes are intended to notify another application that, e.g., the filler has performed some action on an order that the other application, e.g., the placer, needs to know.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Fillers, placers, and other applications can use event requests, event acknowledgments, and event – notification-type trigger events interchangeably.  However, certain order control codes can originate only from the filler (e.g., CR) and others can only originate from the placer (e.g., CA).</p>

      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">This field is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (See Section 2.A.28, "EI – Entity Identifier").  The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment).  It is assigned by the placer (ordering application).  It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application.  The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, "HD – Hierarchic designator").  The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application.  A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required.  A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs.  The components are separated by component delimiters.</p>

This field has a close relationship to ORC-9 and the TQ1, TQ2 segments in so much as the value in ORC-15 takes precedence over both.  For example, an order is placed on June 1, for an activity that is to be performed over ten days as indicated in the TQ1 segment.  The Filler then receives a cancel message on June 2 with the ORC-9 value of June 2, but the ORC-15 Order Effective Date/Time indicated the cancel is to be effective on June 7th.  ORC-15 by taking precedence over TQ1 and ORC-9, would tell the Filler to continue to perform the order event until June 7, and cancel all remaining events (treatment, procedures etc..) after that time.  If the order identified in the ORC has children, the children which have not started should be canceled; if there is a child in process, it should be discontinued; if a child has progressed beyond the point where it can be discontinued, its status is unaffected.</p>

<div>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  This field contains the explanation (either in coded or text form) of the reason for the order event described by the order control code (<a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/v2/0119/index.html">HL7 Table 0119  - Order control codes</a>).  Whereas an NTE after the order-specific segment (e.g., RXO, ORO, OBR) would provide a comment for that specific segment, the purpose of the order control code reason is only to expand on the reason for the order event.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented"><a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-16">ORC-16-order control code reason</a> is typically not valued when <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-1">ORC-1-order control</a> is NW, although it could be.  In the case of a canceled order, for example, this field is commonly used to explain the cancellation.  A Pharmacy system that canceled a drug order from a physician because of a well-documented allergy would likely report the fact of the allergy in this field.  </p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">If it canceled the order because of a drug interaction this field might contain at least the names (and codes, if needed) of the interacting substances, the text describing the interaction, and the level of severity of the interaction.</p>

ORC-36: Order Status Date Range (<a href='/2021Jan/data-type/DR.html'>DR</a>) 03509
</h4>
<div>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  This field is a Filler assigned date/time indicating a date range that the ORC-5 Order Status is intended to be effective.  For example, if the Filler recommends an alternate test, and sets the ORC-5 status to “Hold”, this date/time reflects how long the Filler will keep the order in that status (Barring additional communications from the Placer or Filler in regard to this order.)  When the date is outside the specified order status date range, ORC-5 (Order Status) should be considered an unspecified status, i.e., the status represented in ORC-5 would not necessarily be reflective of the actual status anymore. </p>

ORC-37: Order Creation Date/Time (<a href='/2021Jan/data-type/DTM.html'>DTM</a>) 03515
</h4>
<div>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  This field represents the official date/time when the order was originally created; whether as an electronic order or as an initial paper requisition.  This may also be known as Prescription Date/Time.  This date/time is designed to preserve the creation date/time from initial order to final result, and for all stages in-between.  (Acknowledgments, Updates, Cancels, Results etc.).  When ORC-1 Order Control Code is “NW” for a new order, this date/time, if valued, is typically expected to be the same as ORC-9 Date/Time of Order Event.  An example where the ORC-37, Order Creation Date/Time, is not the same as ORC-9, Date/Time of Order Event, while ORC-1, Order Control Code, is “NW” is when the order originally was recorded and signed by a physician on paper (ORC-37), but not entered in a system until some time (ORC-9) thereafter.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">As different date/times can be considered the initiation of the order (the first person entering it or a subsequent step), or data is not available (e.g., a paper request without a date/time when it was created), the system where the order was first documented determines which date/time it reflects according to the organization's policies and would represent that in ORC-37.<br>When an order is resulted (ORC-1 = “RE”) the value in ORC-37 does not change from the value supplied in the original order.</p>

</h4>
<div>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  This field contains a unique identifier for the Order Group as referenced by the Filler application. An Order Group is a set of orders grouped together by the placer application.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The first component is a string that uniquely identifies all order groups from the filler application.  A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The second through fourth components constitute a filler application ID identical to the analogous components of <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-3">ORC-3-filler order number </a>.
