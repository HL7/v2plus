      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">If a new appointment must be booked, it may be necessary to provide a schedule ID to uniquely identify the intended slot(s) being requested in the transaction.  After the request has been assigned to one or more slots; however, the filler application should assign a unique filler appointment ID (see sections <a href="/2021Jan/composition/Scheduling.html#Scheduling-6-1-1">10.6.1.1</a>, "<a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ARQ.html#ARQ-1">ARQ-1   Placer Appointment ID   (EI)   00860</a>," and <a href="/2021Jan/composition/Scheduling.html#Scheduling-6-1-2">10.6.1.2</a>, "<a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ARQ.html#ARQ-2">ARQ-2   Filler Appointment ID   (EI)   00861</a>)."  This filler appointment ID, as its definition indicates, should uniquely identify the appointment among all such requests and appointments within the filler application.  This means that, once assigned, the filler appointment ID should uniquely identify the appointment (either as a request or as a booked appointment) without a need to provide the schedule ID too.  As a cautionary note regarding implementation, if the filler appointment ID would not otherwise be unique, it may be necessary to include the schedule ID as part of the filler appointment ID.  This can be done either by prefixing the appointment ID with the schedule ID, or by appending the schedule ID to the appointment ID.</p>

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment).  It is assigned by the placer (ordering application).  It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application.  The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, "HD – Hierarchic designator").  The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application.  A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required.  A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs.

It is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (see Chapter 2, section 2.A.28, "EI – entity identifier").</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The first component is a string that identifies an individual order segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment).  It is assigned by the order filling (receiving) application.  It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory).   This uniqueness must persist over time.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, "HD – hierarchic designator").  The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network.  A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required.  The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">See <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-3">ORC-3-filler order number</a> for information on when this field must be valued.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues.  The data in <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-2">ORC-2</a> and <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/OBR.html#OBR-2">OBR-2</a> are logically the same thing: a placer id.  The data in <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-3">ORC-3</a> and <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/OBR.html#OBR-3">OBR-3</a> are logically the same thing: the filler id.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">From that perspective, each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a "Send Number" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair.  The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments. </p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations.  For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations.  In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application.  </p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with <a href="/2021Jan/segment-definition/ORC.html#ORC-1">ORC-1-order control</a> equal to "CA" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself.</p>

      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">Definition:  This field is the order number associated with the filling application.  Where a transcription service or similar organization creates the document and uses an internally unique identifier, that number should be inserted in this field.  Its first component is a string of characters that identifies an order detail segment (i.e., OBR).  This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (i.e., transcription service).  This uniqueness must persist over time.  Where a number is reused over time, a date can be affixed to the non-unique number to make it unique.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">The second through fourth components contains the (filler) assigning authority.  The (filler) assigning authority is a string of characters that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network.  The second through fourth components of the filler order number always identify the actual filler of an order.</p>
      <p class="v2 v2-normalindented">TXA-15 - Condition: If corresponding ORC and/or OBR segments are present in the message and ORC-3 or OBR-3 is valued, this field must be blank.  If TXA-14 is valued while ORC-3 or OBR-3 is valued it shall be ignored.  See message definitions including TXA for further guidanceon which ORC/OBR pairs to consider.</p>
